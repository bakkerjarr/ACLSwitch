# Test: Verify that no traffic can flow through the network when it
#       originates from host 1 when using a Time-state rule.Care must
#       be taken that this test is run on host 1 with an IPv4 address
#       of 10.0.0.1. The ACL rules can be found in
#       TimeDispatch_TwoHost_DropH1_rules.json
#
# Usage: python TimeDispatch_TwoHost_DropH1 <number of hosts in the network>
#
# Test success: All traffic receives some form of response (dependent 
#               on protocol).
# Test failure: At least one flow does not received an answer.
#
# Note:
#   - Test output can be found in TimeDispatch_TwoHost_DropH1_results.log
#
#   - Scapy is used for packet manipulation.
#
#   - The script assumes that the host is part of the 10.0.0.0/24
#     subnet.
#
#   - The script assumes that the syntax for the REST commands are
#     legal.
