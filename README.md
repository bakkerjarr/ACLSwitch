# ACLSwitch

ACLSwitch is an application for the Ryu controller that offers a
firewalling solution for a software defined network.

## Repository Description
ACLSwitch was originally developed as part of a final year Bachelor of
Engineering Honours project (ENGR489) at Victoria University of
Wellington in 2015. The original repository contains files that were
necessary for development and assessment of the honours project. This
repository was established in order to foster future development by
including the implementation code for instance but none of the resources
that were appropriate for ENGR489.

The original repository used in the process for the honours project can
found at https://github.com/bakkerjarr/ENGR489_2015_JarrodBakker.
